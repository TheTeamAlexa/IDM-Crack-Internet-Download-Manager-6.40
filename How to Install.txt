4. ABOUT ANTIVIRUS AND COMPRESSED BINARIES
================================================================================

This release's binary is packed with an executable/dll compression tool to
reduce his size (for an easy and quick upload/download).

Unfortunatly, some of these compression programs have a bad reputation in the
security software industry, mainly because almost 99% of troyans/worms/etc.
is packed with similar tools (or variants of these), and this self-unpack
behavior is taken by some antivirus apps as an alarm signal.

Basically, this means that any trusted program packed with one of these tools
can be erroneously detected as a virus, something know as a "FALSE POSITIVE".

********************************************************************************
IMPORTANT: If you got this release from us, from the site indicated above or from
our official torrent websites accounts so just ignore any warning from your antivirus
software (most certainly it's a false positive).

IF YOU GOT THIS FROM ELSEWHERE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT YOUR COPY WILL BE FREE
OF ANY THREAT; IN THAT CASE, I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGED CAUSED
TO YOUR COMPUTER. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
